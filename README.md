## Install

Install attention.js is quite easy.

### Install script

Just include the script `customNotification.js` into your project and put the script before the closing body tag.

``` html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="customNotification.js`"></script>
    </body>
</html>

```
## Components

### Error

``` javascript

   <custom-notification id="error"></custom-notification>

```

### Success

``` javascript

   <custom-notification id="success"></custom-notification>

```

### Info

``` javascript

   <custom-notification id="info"></custom-notification>

```
### Notes

To show and hide the notification dialog you need to add that logic in your code. For exapmle use v-if directive in Vue js.
